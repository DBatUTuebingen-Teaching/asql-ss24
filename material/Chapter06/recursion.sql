-- ➊a macro that re-implements the

--
CREATE OR REPLACE MACRO my_generate_series(α,ω,step := 1) AS TABLE

  __series(generate_series) AS (
    SELECT α::int64
      UNION ALL
    SELECT generate_series + step

-- Now use our own variant of generate_series()
SELECT s.i

-- ➋ In the UNION variant, only previously undiscovered rows are added
--   to the final result and fed into the next iteration:
--
WITH RECURSIVE
series(i) AS (
  VALUES (1)
    UNION
  SELECT s.i + δ AS i -- generates one known + one new row (only the new row is kept)
  FROM   series AS s, (VALUES (0), (1)) AS _(δ)
  WHERE  s.i < 10
)
TABLE series;

-- ➌ UNION ALL variant: *all* rows generated in the iteration are added to
--   the result and fed into the next iteration:
--
WITH RECURSIVE
series(i) AS (
  VALUES (1)
    UNION ALL -- ⚠️ bag semantics
  SELECT s.i + 1 AS i -- generates two rows for any input row (*both* rows are kept)
  FROM   series AS s, (VALUES (0), (1)) AS _
  WHERE  s.i < 5
)
TABLE series;

-- ➍ Quiz: What will happen (and why?) with this UNION ALL variant of query ➋?
--
WITH RECURSIVE
series(i) AS (

    UNION ALL -- ⚠️ bag semantics
  SELECT s.i + δ AS i -- generates one known + one new row for any input row (*both* rows are kept)
  FROM   series AS s, (VALUES (0), (1)) AS _(δ)
